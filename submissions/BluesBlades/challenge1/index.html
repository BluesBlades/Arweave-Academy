                    Remember... There's no such thing as the 
                    <span class="highlight">real</span> world. What each person sees and feelsâ€” 
                    Those are what shape reality. This is what gives the world infinite potential. 
                    Even if you feel that only <span class="highlight">darkness</span> lies ahead... 
                    As long as you hold hands together... See it through as one... 
                    ...the world will never end! The world exists within all of you...!
